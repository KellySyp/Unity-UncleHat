{Not much. What's Up with you?} GOTO Up

-Ride
Kelly: Umm.... How do you ride again?
Uncle Hat: You forgot how to ride? What a knucklehead!
Uncle Hat: Just stand next to the quad and press the space bar. 
Uncle Hat: Then you can move around with the arrow keys or AWSD.
Kelly: Awesome! This is going to be just like that Scene in Final Fantasy VII--
Uncle Hat: Kelly, This isn't a video game.
Kelly: ...
Uncle Hat: Don't forget, you can't pick stuff up on the Quad so you have to press the space bar again to hop off.
Kelly: Got it! 

GOTO END

Uncle Hat: Well ya better hurry up and ride before sundown!

GOTO END

-END
